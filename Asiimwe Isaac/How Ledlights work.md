The led lights use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) this enables dimming and brightening of the light produced by the light. This is through controlling the rate at which the led lights blink in other words frequency. Thereâ€™s an aspect of resolution which shows the highest and lowest level of brightness 
The led lights are connected to the pin2 of the esp32 because it favors PWM.

How are the LED Lights connected 
The anode is connected to the pin 2 with the resistor to prevent it from blowing.
The cathode is connected to the ground
