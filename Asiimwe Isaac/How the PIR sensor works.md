The PIR motion sensor is used to detect motion. It uses infrared signals to detect motion. Since motion is a digital reading ( 0s and 1s) . The PIR motion is connected to the pin15 of the esp32 that allows input of digital readings.
The PIR motion sensor uses heat from moving bodies to detect motion

How the PIR is connected to the esp32.
The PIR has a pin connected to the 5V pin of the esp32.
The middle pin connected to the pin 15 of the esp32
The other pin connected to the ground.

CHALLENGES FACED WHEN working with the PIR motion sensor

sometimes the Pir sensor is so sensitive and it measures all kinds of motion. some times it is not as very sensistive
